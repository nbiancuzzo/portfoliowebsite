# portfoliowebsite
Website for Portfolio


## General Information
The purpose of this project was to create a web presence for myself for potential employers to refer to. This can help with the job search. I used simple HTML and CSS in order to create this website and pushed it to Microsoft Azure in order to make it live on the web. I then applied my namecheap domain through Azure so that my website shows up as nickbiancuzzo.com

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio Code

## Notable Categories within Website
About Me, Work Experience, a link to my GitHub and a link to my LinkedIn

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to Mike Colbert who taught me these skills in Digital Product Management (BAIS:3300 at the University of Iowa).

## Room for Improvement
This website can certainly be added to with some of my skills that I acquire throughout my schooling and throughout my career. Also, the Work Experience section can be added to as I gain more experience in the workforce
