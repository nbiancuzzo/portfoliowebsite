# portfoliowebsite
Website for Portfolio


## General Information
The purpose of this project was to create a web presence for myself for potential employers to refer to. This can help with the job search. I used simple HTML and CSS in order to create this website and pushed it to Microsoft Azure in order to make it live on the web. I then applied my namecheap domain through Azure so that my website shows up as nickbiancuzzo.com
