        I am currently a student at the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business. I am originally from Iowa City, Iowa and graduate in May of 2022. My post-grad plans are to go into the Masters of Finance program at the University of Iowa's Tippie College of Business. Some of my hobbies include traveling, fishing and watching sports. I am an avid Iowa Hawkeye, Milwaukee Brewer, Milwaukee Buck and Green Bay Packer fan.
